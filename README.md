Introduction
The objective of this project is to figure out how we can predict which individuals are most likely to have or use a bank account. The solution will help provide an indication of the state of financial inclusion in Kenya, Rwanda, Tanzania, and Uganda, while providing insights into some of the key demographic factors that might drive individuals’ financial outcomes.
